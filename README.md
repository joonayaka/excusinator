# Excusinator
A data science project using logistic regression to classify student's excuses into multiple categories.

This project is a machine learning-based excuse classifier that predicts what kind of excuse a student is giving for not doing homework. It features a clean, interactive GUI and supports real-time learning and retraining.

## Features

 - Classifies excuses into categories (e.g., *funny*, *plausible*, *fake*, etc.)
 - Uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for text classification
 - Interactive **Tkinter GUI**
 - Displays prediction confidence for each category
 - Asks the user if the prediction was correct
 - Allows manual correction if incorrect
 - Saves new examples to the dataset
 - **Automatically retrains** the model on each new input
 - Displays a **confusion matrix** after every retraining
 - Extra: save weights for the trained model and vectorizer
 - Extra: load previously saved weights if needed

## Dataset Format

The classifier uses a CSV file with the following format:


text,label
"My dog ate my homework",funny
"I had a family emergency",plausible


- The file **must** be in the same directory as the Python script
- The classifier automatically detects the first `.csv` file

## How It Works

1. Loads the CSV and trains a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn
2. Builds a TF-IDF matrix from excuse text
3. Provides a GUI for entering excuses
4. Displays predicted category and confidence scores
5. Updates the dataset and retrains the model on each confirmed or corrected example
6. Shows a **confusion matrix heatmap** after retraining

## üõ† Requirements

Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

This project uses:

- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (included in standard Python)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- joblib

## Running the Program

```bash
python excusinator.py
```

Make sure your CSV file (e.g., `excuses.csv`) is in the same folder as `excusinator.py`.

## Example Use

1. Enter an excuse like ‚ÄúI overslept because of a time zone change.‚Äù
2. Click **Predict**
3. Review the predicted label and confidence scores
4. Click ‚úÖ if the prediction is correct or ‚ùå to correct it
5. The program appends the new example to the dataset and retrains the model
6. A confusion matrix is shown to visualize current performance

## Confusion Matrix

After each retraining, a heatmap is displayed to show how well the model is performing on different classes using a 20% test split.

## Files Created

 - `model_weights.pkl`: Trained logistic regression model
 - `vectorizer.pkl`: Trained TF-IDF vectorizer
 - Appended `your_dataset.csv`: With new labeled examples

## Notes

 - The program retrains **every time a new example is added**
 - No internet access is required ‚Äî everything runs locally
 - The GUI is responsive and works on most desktops (Windows/Linux/Mac)

## Future Improvements

 - Save model accuracy over time
 - Track user corrections and visualize model drift
 - Web-based version using Streamlit or Flask
